## ðŸšœ How This Search Works

Welcome! Ask Stardew Wiki is designed to help you find precise information on the Stardew Valley Wiki faster.


* What it DOES: It's a smarter search engine than the wiki's built-in search which relies on simple keyword matching. This tool understands the meaning and context of your query, finds the most conceptually relevant wiki sections, and then shows you the source, verbatim.
* What it DOES NOT do: It is not a generative AI chatbot. It won't invent answers, write new sentences, give personal opinions, or summarize topics in its own words. Also, wiki administration and community pages are not included in this search.

Think of it like a super-powered Ctrl+F that searches the most of wiki for you! You get the reliable information from the source, pointing to the exact sections of wiki pages without scrolling.


## ðŸ¤” Is This an AI?

**No. This is a Search Engine based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), without a generative LLM integration**. To be clear:

| Wiki's search  | This Tool âœ… | An AI Chatbot |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Simple keyword matching in page titles and content  | Finds deeply relevant wiki sections by semantic comparison against the most wiki content  | Writes new, original text |
| Provides links to the pages | Provide sources & links to wiki sections   | May answer with incorrect or outdated or "hallucinate" facts |
| Best for finding a specific page by name (e.g., "Starfruit")    | Best for asking questions to the wiki and finding the source (e.g., "How do I get iridium ore?", "What does Sebastian like?") | Best for summary, explanations and calculations (e.g., "What's the profit margin for blueberries?") |


In short, Ask Stardew Wiki finds the needle in the haystack smartly, then hand you the needle -- not an AI-generated drawing of one.
